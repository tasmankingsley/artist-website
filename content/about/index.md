# About

This is an example website depicting a fictional artist's website.
I developed this site to learn and practice the Nuxt Vue.js framework, 
including its markdown headless CMS (content management system) capabilities.
In order to provide gallery content to this artist website, i used some very basic (and admittedly bad) generative art that i created one afternoon while i was having fun experimenting with
Matt DesLauriers' awesome [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) framework.
