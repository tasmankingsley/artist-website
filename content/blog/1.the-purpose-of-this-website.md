# The purpose of this website

#### First of all, why did i make it?

I created this website as a learning experience, to explore and practice using the Nuxt framework.
I also wanted to add an Artist style website to my porfolio website. 
An artist's website usually features a clean and minimal design, a gallery, a blog (sometimes), and
an about/contact section. Creating this website was good practice for learning/designing some of those
features.

#### What did i use to make it?

The Nuxt Vue.js framework was used for development (specifically Nuxt3 + Vue3), and the canvas-sketch framework was used for creating some very basic and experimental generative art.
Nuxt has a headless CMS (content management system) plugin feature called 'Nuxt Content', which i took advantage of to make this blog section of the website. The headless CMS allows using markdown
files for writing and organising content (without having to use a server - hence headless).
Using markdown files is quite a bit easier to compose with, which makes writing more fun.
